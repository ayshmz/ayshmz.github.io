# ayshmz's personal website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can go directly to the website through this [link](https://ayshmz.github.io).

The site is still being built, but here are a couple of cool features:
- If you click on the second cat on the screen (the one in the middle) it will open a chatbox that runs on OpenAI's chatGPT. It's been trained to pretend like it is my cat, Chestnut. He will give you details on his life if you ask him questions. The chatbox currently only allows for 10 interactions total to limit the token number.
- All interactions with the chatbot are recorded and stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted in Railway. I plan to be using this for another project so if you do not want your interactions to be used, please do not enter anything in the chatbox.
- If you hover over my roles in the experiences section, a Tooltip will appear with the technologies I used most in those roles.
- If you click on the roles in the experience section, you'll see a short description of the work I did for each of the roles.

The work on this website is still ongoing (like writing unit tests!). Thanks for visiting!
